al. 2018.pdf” “Aragao-Santiago, L 2016.pdf” “Cabral, H et al 2005.pdf”  
Has been downloaded in the 20 April of 2021. They were absent from the
repository in pdf.

This may explain why the double box plot only contains 28 points, where
the manual ranking contain 33 articles. 3 were missing.

    ## [1] "2. Materials and methods 2. 1. Materials Zinc oxide nanopowder was purchased from Iranian Nanomaterials Pioneers Company, NANOSANY (Mashhad, Iran). Its characteristics are presented in Table 1 and transmission electron micrograph (TEM) and crystal characteristics of ZnO nanoparticles are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. 2. 2. Preparation of nanoparticle suspension A stock suspension was prepared by suspending ZnO nanoparticles in bi-distilled water. 2. 3. Experimental design and procedure Thirty adult male Wistar rats aged 6 e 8 weeks, weighing 180e 200 gwere purchased from Pasteur Institute of Iran, IRAN. The animals were housed two rats per plastic cage and allowed to acclimatize under standard conditions (12 h light/dark cycles) for one week. The rats were given free access to distilled water and commercialized food throughout the experiment. The animals were divided into five groups of six animals each. Groups one to four received a dose of 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO)/kg body weight and assigned nZnO 50, nZnO 100, nZnO 150 and nZnO 200 groups, respectively. The rats were injected intraperitoneally daily for ten days. The control group was injected with bi-distilled water and the effect of shock injection is the same in all groups. At the end of the study, the rats were scarified and blood samples were collected from healthy control and ZnO nanoparticles treated groups by cardiac puncture, using 23 or 26 G needles. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, and serum were separated and analyzed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities and measurement of Maolnedialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS). The rats were also studied for histological examination of liver and renal tissue and sperm analysis. The experimental procedurewas approved at the Faculty of Medicine at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (UMSHA) and the researchTable 1 Characteristics of zinc oxide nanoparticles. Certificate of analysis Content ZnO% Cu 99% 3 ppm Particles size nm Specific surface area m 2/g Color 10e 30 20e 60 Milky whitewas conducted according to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of UMSHA. 2. 4. Measurement of superoxide dismutase activity Superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyzes the breakdown of the superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The method was carried out following the procedure of Marklund andMarklund (1974). In this method, one unit of SOD activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the autoxidation of pyrogallol by 50%. Autoxidation of pyrogallol was quantified at 420 nm for 3 min. Therefore, the rate of decreased optical density between the 1 st and 3 rd min was expressed as enzyme activity in a UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Unico S 2100, USA) with recorder. 2. 5. Measurement of glutathione peroxidase activity Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was determined based on the potential of the enzyme to reduce H 2 O 2. According to the study of Paglia and Valentine (1967), GPX converts H 2 O 2 to H 2 O and catalyzes GSH to GSSG simultaneously. The optical density of the final mixture was read at 340 nm in UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Unico S 2100, USA) with recorder. Decrease of OD was expressed as enzyme activity, U/L. 2. 6. Measurement of MDA, TAC and TOS Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in serum samples was assessed using ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) (Benzie and Strain, 1999). Maolnedialdehyde (MDA) as a lipid peroxidation index was determined using fluorometric thiobarbituric acid method (Botsoglou et al., 1994). The oxidation of ferrous ion to ferric ion accompanied with a number of oxidant species in acidic pH was used for the measurement of total oxidant status (TOS) in serum. The ferric ion was determined by xylenol orange (Erel, 2005).Mn Cd Pb 5 ppm 9 ppm 9 ppm Crystal phase Crystal Morphology True density g/cm 3 Single Nearly spherical 5. 606 Fig. 2.

Sperm analysis At the end of the study after anesthetizing the animals and removing the epididymis, sperm analysis was performed. The sperm count was assessed using a haemocytometer. Also, the qualitative and quantitative morphology and motility of sperms were observed with a light microscope (Ziess, 015447, Germany) and their vitality was studied with Eosin dye. Then, the percentage of live sperms to the total sperms was evaluated with a magnification of 40. The dead sperms were observed in reddish color. The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using SPSS statistical software and One-Way ANOVA test was analyzed at a significant level of less than 0. 05. 2. 9. Histopathological study At the end of the study, the rats were sacrificed and examined for tissue abnormalities. Samples of liver and kidney from all groups were immediately fixed in 10% formalin overnight, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 mm sections, placed on slides andTable 2 Effect of treatment with zinc oxide nanoparticles on rats serum oxidant and antioxidant Parameters Groups Control nZno 50 nZno 100 SOD (U/L) 25. 29 ± 9. 54 29. 49 ± 11. 85 40. 00 ± 7 GPX (U/L) 1. 76 ± 0. 91 1. 08 ± 0. 49 2. 21 ± 0 TAC (mmol/ml) 1. 24 ± 0. 36 1. 06 ± 0. 20 1. 06 ± 0 MDA (mm/l) 0. 34 ± 0. 21 0. 69 ± 0. 40 1. 21 ± 0 TOS (mmol/ml) 1. 80 ± 1. 44 2. 28 ± 0. 59 2. 44 ± 0 All values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. *p < 0. 05; DP < 0. 01; #p < 0. 001.

Samples of liver and kidney from all groups were immediately fixed in 10% formalin overnight, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 mm sections, placed on slides andTable 2 Effect of treatment with zinc oxide nanoparticles on rats serum oxidant and antioxidant Parameters Groups Control nZno 50 nZno 100 SOD (U/L) 25. 29 ± 9. 54 29. 49 ± 11. 85 40. 00 ± 7 GPX (U/L) 1. 76 ± 0. 91 1. 08 ± 0. 49 2. 21 ± 0 TAC (mmol/ml) 1. 24 ± 0. 36 1. 06 ± 0. 20 1. 06 ± 0 MDA (mm/l) 0. 34 ± 0. 21 0. 69 ± 0. 40 1. 21 ± 0 TOS (mmol/ml) 1. 80 ± 1. 44 2. 28 ± 0. 59 2. 44 ± 0 All values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. *p < 0. 05; DP < 0. 01; #p < 0. 001.

For statistical analysis, the experimental values were compared to their corresponding control. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS software (Version 16. 0) was used to illustrate the significant difference between the experimental and control groups. The significant difference was considered to be p < 0. 05 or less. 3."

### What about the two articles on which it fails ?

Running the code line by line, on Bendre, V et al 2011.pdf, it appears
that clean\_title\_journal(pdf\_name, section\_title\_df) remove all
section title because the article only does 2 pages.

Richter, AW et al 1983.pdf is a pdf, but a pdf of a scan, and has no
information regarding or, well, text.
